    <h1>Insurance Policy</h1>
    <p>We recognize the importance of safeguarding your belongings during moving at OG Movers. While we handle each item carefully, we understand that accidents and unforeseen incidents can occur. We offer full insurance coverage for your items while in transit to provide peace of mind. This policy outlines the terms and conditions of our coverage.</p>

    <h2>Policy Coverage</h2>
    <p>Our full insurance cover applies from the moment we start packing and moving your items until they are delivered and unpacked at your new location. It covers damages or losses incurred during:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Packing and unpacking by our professional removalists.</li>
        <li>Transit between your old and new location.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Claim Procedure</h2>
    <p><strong>Damage Discovery:</strong> In case you discover any damage or loss, promptly document it. Take clear photographs showing the damage.</p>
    <p><strong>Damage Report:</strong> Notify us within 24 hours of delivery completion. Please email us detailing the damage or loss, including the photographs taken and any additional information that can help us understand the issue better.</p>
    <p><strong>Claim Submission:</strong> We will properly review your claim and initiate the claim process with our insurance company. We will provide you with a unique claim number for future correspondence and tracking purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Claim Assessment:</strong> Our insurance company will assess the claim, which may include an examination of the damaged items, their original condition, and their market value at the time of loss or damage.</p>
    <p><strong>Claim Approval and Compensation:</strong> If the claim is approved, our insurance policy will determine the compensation that will be provided. This may include repair, replacement, or financial compensation, depending on the extent and nature of the damage or loss.</p>

    <h2>Exclusions</h2>
    <p>Please note that certain items and circumstances are not covered by our insurance policy, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Items packed by customers.</li>
        <li>Pre-existing damage or faults.</li>
        <li>Valuables such as jewelry, money, important documents, etc., unless previously agreed upon and declared.</li>
